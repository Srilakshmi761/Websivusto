        <h3 class="custom-subheading mt-2">Chai with Biscuit to Coffee with Cake</h3>
       <p></p>
        <p class="lead"> From the warm, noisy mornings of India with chai and biscuits to the calm, quiet coffee moments in Finland with a slice of cake this is my journey. I'm an Indian mom living in Finland, sharing everyday stories, funny culture shocks, parenting adventures, and the sweet (and sometimes confusing!) blend of two worlds. </p>
        <p class="lead"> After landing in Finland, everything felt different. I had moved from a fast, colorful, noisy life to a place that was slow, silent, and at first a little lonely. It was winter, and I honestly couldn’t tell if the sun had taken a vacation too! </p>
        <p class="lead"> I missed my job, my relatives, the buzz of Indian life even the traffic jams. But slowly, little things started making me smile. Soon after we moved, our second child was born here in Finland, bringing more joy and warmth into our new life. Watching my baby take their first steps in the snow, experiencing the beauty of silence, and learning that sisu isn’t a spice but a Finnish kind of strength were all part of this new chapter.</p>
        <p class="lead"> This blog is my space to share honest experiences not as an expert, but as a mom learning and growing between two worlds. I write from the heart, with love and respect for both my homes: India and Finland. </p>

            <p class="lead my-3">After receiving our Finnish citizenship, we were deeply touched to receive this beautiful greeting card from our lovely neighbour. The card showed everything close to my heart. It felt like our journey captured in one picture leaving behind the warmth of India, and finding new roots in the calm beauty of Finland. This simple gesture reminded me how kindness can bloom even in the snow.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">From the Equator Heat to Arctic Snow</h5>
        <p class="card-text text-muted">Posted on May 12, 2025</p>
    <p class="card-text">Moving from India to Finland brought a huge change in how I experience weather. In India, summers can reach 45°C or more, making it hard to even step outside. In contrast, Finnish winters, especially in the north, can drop to -35°C or lower something I had never imagined before coming here.</p>
    <p class="card-text">I saw snow for the first time in Finland, and it felt magical! Despite the freezing cold, indoor heating keeps our home warm around 22°C, though our electricity bills do go up in winter. One of my favourite winter activities is playing in the snow with my kids building snowmen, sliding, and trying (still learning!) to ski.</p>
     <p class="card-text full-text d-none">Winters also mean short days and long nights, especially in the north, where the sun doesn’t rise for weeks. It took time to adjust, but we enjoy cozy days indoors, often watching TV as a family. Then comes summer bright and full of life! In June, the Midnight Sun means the sun stays out even at midnight. It was shocking at first even closed windows can’t block all the light but now I find it beautiful. The sky feels close, and everything seems full of energy.</p>
        <p class="card-text full-text d-none">Finns love being outdoors in summer, especially by the lakes, and the Midsummer Festival is a highlight. I especially enjoyed celebrating it in Riga, Latvia a truly special memory. </p>
       <p class="card-text full-text d-none">Compared to India’s steady sunrise and sunset times, Finland’s extreme seasons were a big surprise. But over time, I’ve come to love both the peaceful winters and the bright, endless summer days.</p>

<h5 class="card-title"> From Spices to Cheese </h5>
<p class="card-text text-muted">Posted on May 12, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-text"> When it comes to food, the culture in Finland is completely different from India. Back home, due to the warm climate, we grow a lot of vegetables and rice is a staple. Indian food is known for its spices we can’t cook without masalas! We mostly ate vegetarian dishes and had meat only occasionally. </p>
      <p class="card-text"> But in Finland, because of the long and cold winters, there are fewer fresh vegetables, and root vegetables are common which I found hard to eat at first. Since we live far from Helsinki, it’s difficult to go often to Indian stores, and even when we do, it’s hard to find fresh Indian veggies. So, we slowly started eating more chicken and began adjusting to local vegetables. </p>
      <p class="card-text full-text d-none"> I still remember my first pizza experience in Finland we didn’t like it at all! Even pizzas taste different from those in India. But over time, I’ve started enjoying Finnish pizzas too. We don’t usually go to traditional Finnish restaurants, as the food doesn’t suit our taste. Instead, we go for burgers, pizzas, sushi, and sometimes Indian restaurants. </p>
      <p class="card-text full-text d-none"> Now that I’m working, I often eat Finnish food at daycare, and I’ve started liking it. But my husband still hasn’t fully adjusted. </p>
      <p class="card-text full-text d-none"> My favourite Indian foods are all kinds of vegetable curries with roti, chicken biryani, Indian sweets, and traditional snacks. From Finnish cuisine, I enjoy fish soup, pasta box (makaroonilaatikko), and of course, all types of cakes so yummy! We’ve also found grilling very easy and convenient here, so we often prepare grilled dishes at home. </p>
      <p class="card-text full-text d-none"> Bit by bit, we’ve adjusted to Finnish food, while still keeping our Indian flavours alive at home.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">From Hyderabad to Helsinki: A Lifestyle Transformation</h5>
      <p class="card-text text-muted">Posted on May 12, 2025</p>
<p class="card-text short-text">Moving from Hyderabad, India, to Finland has been a significant shift in every aspect of life, particularly when it comes to daily routines, work-life balance, and household management. In India, with a population of over 1.4 billion, the streets are often crowded, leaving little space to walk freely. In contrast, Finland’s population of around 5.5 million results in calm, spacious streets where people respect personal space and keep their distance. This stark difference has affected everything from commuting to social interactions, creating a much slower pace of life. </p>
<p class="card-text full-text d-none">In Hyderabad, the distance between my husband’s workplace and mine is 30 km. However, due to heavy traffic, it would take him anywhere from 1 to 3 hours to reach work, which meant he left at 7 AM and didn’t return home until 10 PM, leaving no time for himself during the week. Weekends were mostly spent catching up on sleep. Meanwhile, I worked six days a week with only Sundays off, a gruelling routine with little time for self-care or personal activities. </p>
<p class="card-text full-text d-none">In Finland, however, the situation is dramatically different. My daily commute is just a 30-minute walk, and my husband's is a 5-minute drive. We now have the time to unwind, eat healthily, and focus on self-care. The short commute and calm surroundings allow us to embrace a better work-life balance and even make time for gym sessions and family walks, things I never had the opportunity to focus on back in India. </p>
<p class="card-text full-text d-none">One of the hardest adjustments has been the shift in household responsibilities. In India, we had a maid who would clean our house, leaving me with more time to focus on cooking. But in Finland, labour charges are high, and we can’t afford a maid. At first, doing all the chores ourselves was tough, but over time, it’s become part of our routine and surprisingly, it’s become a form of exercise! While I miss the convenience of a maid, I’ve learned to appreciate the physical activity and the sense of accomplishment that comes with doing things ourselves. </p>
<p class="card-text full-text d-none">This lifestyle change has allowed us to prioritize our health, something that was hard to do in the rush of daily life in India. Now, we eat healthier, exercise more, and have time for ourselves. In India, I never had the chance to focus on these aspects of life, but in Finland, we’ve found the time to slow down and enjoy the simple things something I never thought possible in the hustle of city life. </p>
